# The Vim Configuration of Champions

[Forked from mutewinter](http://gitego.com/mutewinter/dot_vim)

## Installation

1. `git clone http://github.com/jh3/dot_vim.git` in your home folder.
2. `mv dot_vim .vim`
3. `cd .vim`
4. `rake vim:link` to make the .vimrc symbolic link.
5. Install [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) with `git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git bundle/vundle`
6. Run Vim and type `:BundleInstall` to install the plugins with Vundle.
7. Enjoy enhanced productivity, increased levitation, reduced watermelon-related accidents, and startling sex appeal.

## Requirements

**Mac**

 * [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) - I'm currently using [snapshot 64](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads)

**Windows**

 * [gVim](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc) - I'm currently using [Wu Yongwei's](http://wyw.dcweb.cn) pre-compiled [gVim 7.3.333](http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=gvim73.zip) because it has Ruby support and the latest patches

## Notes

Be sure to always edit the vimrc using `,v`, which opens the vimrc in the .vim folder. Vim has a nasty habit of overriding symlinks.

## Plugin Installation / Requirements

I may make this more verbose later, but for now, here's a list of plugins that require further installation:

 * [Command-T](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T) Needs compilation
 * [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) Requires Git to be installed
 * [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) Requires many different binaries installed depending on what filetypes you want it to check
 * [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) Requires [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) to be installed
